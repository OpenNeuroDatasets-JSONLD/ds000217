	"Instructions": "Participants were instructed to fixate on a red dot in the center of a screen and press a button everytime a scrambled picture appeared on screen.",
	"TaskDescription": "The localizer scan contained 36 alternating blocks of three image types (12 blocks per category): faces, scenes (hallways or houses), and objects (cars or guitars). Each block lasted a total of 6 s and contained 12 greyscale images presented for 500 ms each. Subjects pressed a button whenever they detected a scrambled image, which occurred on half of all blocks (counterbalanced across category). An additional 12 baseline ‘blocks’ showing a blank grey screen (also 6 s each) were randomly interspersed with the other blocks.",
